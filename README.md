# LinkedIn-Profile-Updates
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I wanted to share some recent updates about LinkedIn profile that will be implemented by Feb and March.
## Creator Mode Changes
Two years ago, LinkedIn launched creator mode on LinkedIn, and in the coming months, some changes are on the way. Here's what you can expect:
1. February 2024:
  - Profile hashtags will be removed to simplify the introduction section of your profile.
2. March 2024:
  - The creator mode on/off switch will be removed from the Resources section of your profile.
  - Your About section will move to the top of your profile.
  - You will have the option to choose Follow or Connect as the main CTA on your profileâ€”your CTA will remain Follow unless you update it.

Remember, even with these changes, you will still have access to the tools and analytics you had with creator mode.

Thank you for being a part of my communityâ€”looking forward to what I share next on LinkedIn!
